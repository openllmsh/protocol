/**
 * The surface an EXPLICIT-model plan fetch is for.
 *
 * `GET /api/daemon/plan?model=…` was surface-blind: the daemon asked for
 * whatever model string the client sent, whichever endpoint it arrived on,
 * and the cloud resolved it under the `chat` default. For an unambiguous
 * media id that merely failed to resolve; for an AMBIGUOUS family name it
 * resolved to the wrong thing entirely — `model=grok` on
 * `/v1/images/generations` planned the grok CHAT model, while the cloud's
 * own image handler (which knows its surface) selects grok's image model
 * for the identical request. One request, two answers, decided by which
 * transport happened to serve it.
 *
 * So the surface travels WITH the query. It is the surface NAME, not a
 * capability: the mapping from surface to capability (`image_edit` →
 * `image_editing`, never `image_generation`) already exists once on the
 * cloud, next to the gate that enforces it, and must not be re-stated by
 * every caller.
 *
 * Absent means "no surface stated" and keeps the historical chat-default
 * behaviour — an older compiled daemon never sends it, and a plan it
 * fetches must keep working exactly as before.
