/**
 * Resolve a syntactically non-local URL and accept it only when every DNS
 * answer is globally routable. Node-only: it imports `node:dns/promises`, so it
 * lives outside the package index (`@openllmsh/protocol/url-locality-dns`) to
 * keep edge/browser bundles that import the protocol root free of `node:dns`.
 *
 * This validation must be invoked directly before each hosted fetch. Standard
 * Fetch (undici / Bun) does not expose a portable DNS-pin primitive that
 * connects to the resolved address while preserving Host + TLS SNI, so the
 * established defence is: preflight DNS here, then `redirect: "manual"` with
 * revalidation of every Location before the next hop. A true
 * connect-to-resolved-IP path would require a custom dispatcher and is out of
 * scope for the portable fetch surface this codebase targets.
