// ─── Control channel — the live command lifecycle ────────────────────
//
// The stateless-relay contract: the relay is a pure socket binder (Browser
// WS ↔ Daemon WS) and the daemon is the source of truth. A command is a
// self-contained request → lifecycle → response with NO persistence — no
// `daemon_commands` mailbox, no history, no replay (it lives only as long as
// its sockets). This file owns the command lifecycle the browser drives its
// optimistic UI off; `device-state.ts` owns the snapshot the daemon pushes.
// See `docs/proposals/daemon-owned-state-stateless-relay.md`.
//
// NB: distinct from the daemon's local `packages/daemon/src/control-channel.ts`
// (the partysocket transport impl). This is the SHARED wire contract both ends
// and the relay decode against.

 *
 *   pending  — browser → relay sent; no daemon ack yet (browser-local).
 *   ack      — the daemon received the command and began running it.
 *   done     — completed; the `-s` probe shows the box state actually changed.
 *   not_done — completed; the `-s` probe shows it was already in the desired
 *              state (a measured no-op). Reserved for a daemon-measured no-op —
 *              NEVER a transport rejection (an offline daemon yields `error`).
 *   error    — failed (or the relay had no live daemon socket: `daemon_offline`);
 *              carries `message`.
 *
 * `done`/`not_done` for the install/uninstall family come from the pre/post
 * `install.sh -s` probe (a measured fact, not a handler claim); commands with no
 * `-s` probe (connect/logout/refresh/…) return them from the handler.
