/**
 * The routing verb for a classified hop failure:
 *
 * - `retry_in_place` — transient infra fault; retry the SAME model once, then walk.
 * - `cool_and_advance` — this model/account can't serve now (auth/quota/rate);
 *   cool it and hop to the next model. The ONLY cooling action, so whether a
 *   reason cools is exactly `action === "cool_and_advance"`, and `ttlMs` lives
 *   only on this variant.
 * - `walk_no_cool` — the model is unavailable for this request but another might
 *   serve it (model absent / policy refusal); hop without cooling.
 * - `surface` — the MODEL is fine; the REQUEST is malformed/oversized, so every
 *   model would reject it identically. Surface the authentic error on this model
 *   (no hop, no cool, no retry) — hopping would only cold-miss the next model's
 *   cache and re-bill, and the client's corrected retry lands warm on the same
 *   model.
